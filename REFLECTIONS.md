what you enjoyed about using the chosen framework:

I enjoyed how similar it was to Django. In my intro to software eng class, we are using Django to build a web app.
Angular seemed very similar to Django, and it was nice to see how similar the frameworks are by using a script language,
html files, css, and command line. I enjoyed how the tutorial just gave the code and also explained it well, rather than
just saying what needed to be implemented with some vague hints.


what you disliked:

using TypeScript instead of JavaScript was a little frustrating, just because it was similar enough that my brain
wanted to use JS, but they are just slightly different in syntax and usage, that it was a little annoying.
